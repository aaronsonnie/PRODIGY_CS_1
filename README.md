# PRODIGY_CS_1
This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Users can input a message and a shift value to perform both encryption and decryption.

# Caesar Cipher
This project implements the Caesar Cipher, a straightforward encryption method where each letter in a text is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

# Features
Encryption: Shifts each letter in the input text by a user-defined number of positions.
For example: If you enter "abc" with a shift value of 4, each letter is shifted forward by 4 positions, converting "a" to "e", "b" to "f", and "c" to "g". The final encrypted output will be "efg".

# Decryption
The program can also reverse the encryption process by shifting the letters back to their original positions.

For example: If you input "efg" with a shift value of 4 for decryption, the program will shift each letter back by 4 positions. Thus, "e" becomes "a", and the decrypted output of "efg" will be "abc".

# Usage
To use the program, simply run the Python script and follow the on-screen instructions.

# User Input:
Select whether to encrypt or decrypt a message.
Enter the text to be processed.
Provide the shift value for the encryption or decryption process.
